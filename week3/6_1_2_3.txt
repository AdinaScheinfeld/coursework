6.1 Baby weights, Part I.

(a) Write the equation of the regression line.

bwt_hat = 123.05 - 8.94 * smoke

(b) Interpret the slope in this context,  and calculate the predicted birth weight of babies born to smoker and non-smoker mothers.

In this context, the slope indicates that a baby born to a mother who smokes weights approximately 8.94 oz less than a baby born to a mother who does not smoke.
The predicted birth weight of babies born to smoker mothers is 114.11.
The predicted birth weight of babies born to non-smoker mothers is 123.05.

(c) Is there a statistically significant relationship between the average birth weight and smoking?

There is a statistically significant relationship between the average birth weight and smoking since the p-value is small.


6.2 Baby weights, Part II.

(a) Write the equation of the regression line.

bwt_hat = 120.07 - 1.93 * parity

(b) Interpret the slope in this context, and calculate the predicted birth weight of first borns and others.

In this context, the slope indicates that a first born baby weighs approximately 1.93 oz less than others.
The predicted birth weight of first borns is 118.14.
The predicted birth weight of others is 120.07.

(c) Is there a statistically significant relationship between the average birth weight and parity?

There is not a statistically significant relationship between the average birth weight and whether the baby was a first born since the p-value is large. 


6.3 Baby weights, Part III.

(a) Write the equation of the regression line that includes all of the variables.

bwt_hat = -80.41 + 0.44 * gestation - 3.33 * parity - 0.01 * age + 1.15 * height + 0.05 * weight - 8.40 * smoke

(b) Interpret the slopes of gestation and age in this context.

In this context, the slope of gestation indicates that as gestation increases, the baby weight increases,
and the slope of age indicates that as age increases, baby weight decreases.

(c) The coefficient for parity is different than in the linear model shown in Exercise 6.2. 
Why might there be a difference?

There might be a difference if parity is associated with another variable that is present here but not in the linear model in Exercise 6.2.

(d) Calculate the residual for the first observation in the data set.

bwt_hat = -80.41 + 0.44 * 284 - 3.33 * 0 - 0.01 * 27 + 1.15 * 62 + 0.05 * 100 - 8.40 * 0 = 120.58
residual = 120 - 120.58 = -0.58

(e) The variance of the residuals is 249.28, and the variance of the birth weights of all babies in the data set is 332.57. 
Calculate the R^2 and the adjusted R^2. 
Note that there are 1,236 observations in the data set.
R^2 = 0.258
R^2^adj = 0.2541
