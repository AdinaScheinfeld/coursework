Question 4.1 -  Table 4.6 presents the probabilities of the random variable Y .
These probabilities are a function of the number p, the probability of the value
“0”. Answer the following questions:
1. What is the value of p? 1/21
2. P(Y < 3) = ? 2/7
3. P(Y = odd) = ? 4/7
4. P(1 ≤ Y < 4) = ? 3/7
5. P(|Y − 3| < 1.5) = ? 4/7
6. E(Y ) = ? 70/21
7. Var(Y ) = ? 2.222222
8. What is the standard deviation of Y . 1.490712

Question 4.2 - One invests $2 to participate in a game of chance. In this game a coin is tossed three times. 
If all tosses end up “Head” then the player wins
$10. Otherwise, the player losses the investment.
1. What is the probability of winning the game? 1/8
2. What is the probability of loosing the game? 7/8
3. What is the expected gain for the player that plays this game? -0.75
(Notice that the expectation can obtain a negative value.)

Question 6.1 - Consider the problem of establishing regulations concerning the
maximum number of people who can occupy a lift. In particular, we would like
to assess the probability of exceeding maximal weight when 8 people are allowed
to use the lift simultaneously and compare that to the probability of allowing 9
people into the lift.
Assume that the total weight of 8 people chosen at random follows a normal
distribution with a mean of 560kg and a standard deviation of 57kg. Assume
that the total weight of 9 people chosen at random follows a normal distribution
with a mean of 630kg and a standard deviation of 61kg.

1. What is the probability that the total weight of 8 people exceeds 650kg? 1 - pnorm(650, 560, 57) = 0.05717406

2. What is the probability that the total weight of 9 people exceeds 650kg? 1 - pnorm(650, 630, 61) = 0.3715054

3. What is the central region that contains 80% of distribution of the total weight of 8 people?
qnorm(0.1, 560, 57) = 486.9516
qnorm(0.9, 560, 57) = 633.0484
The central region is: [486.9516, 633.0484]

4. What is the central region that contains 80% of distribution of the total
weight of 9 people?
qnorm(0.1, 630, 61) = 551.8254
qnorm(0.9, 630, 61) = 708.1746
