5.20 Body measurements, Part III. Exercise 5.13 introduces data on shoulder girth and
height of a group of individuals. The mean shoulder girth is 108.20 cm with a standard deviation
of 10.37 cm. The mean height is 171.14 cm with a standard deviation of 9.41 cm. The correlation
between height and shoulder girth is 0.67.

(a) Write the equation of the regression line for predicting height.
height_bar = 105.36 + 0.607 * shoulder_girth

(b) Interpret the slope and the intercept in this context.
slope = For one cm increase in shoulder girth, the model represents an increase in height of 0.607.
intercept = someone with a shoulder girth of 0 is predicted to have a height of 105.36. 

(c) Calculate R^2 of the regression line for predicting height from shoulder girth, 
and interpret it in the context of the application.
R^2 = 0.4489
Approximately 45% of variation in height is accounted for by the model. 

(d) A randomly selected student from your class has a shoulder girth of 100 cm. Predict the height
of this student using the model.
height = 166.06

(e) The student from part (d) is 160 cm tall. Calculate the residual, 
and explain what this residual means.
residual = 160 - 166.06 = -6.06
The model overestimated the student's height by 6.06 cm. 

(f) A one year old has a shoulder girth of 56 cm. 
Would it be appropriate to use this linear model to predict the height of this child?

No, this would require extrapolation and is therefore not appropriate. 


5.29 Body measurements, Part IV. The scatterplot and least squares summary below show
the relationship between weight measured in kilograms and height measured in centimeters of 507
physically active individuals.

(a) Describe the relationship between height and weight.
The relationship is positive and strong.

(b) Write the equation of the regression line. Interpret the slope and intercept in context.
weight_bar = -105.0113 + 1.0176 * height
slope = for one cm increase in height, the model represents a 1.0176 kg increase in weight.
intercept = Someone with a height of 0 is predicted to have a weight of -105.0113

(c) Do the data provide strong evidence that an increase in height is associated with an increase
in weight? State the null and alternative hypotheses, report the p-value, and state your conclusion.
Null hypothesis: There is no correlation between height and weight.
Alternative hypothesis: An increase in height is associated with an increase in weight.
p is small so reject the null.

(d) The correlation coefficient for height and weight is 0.72. 
Calculate R^2 and interpret it in context.
R^2 = 0.5184
Approximately 52% of variation in weight is accounted for by the model.
